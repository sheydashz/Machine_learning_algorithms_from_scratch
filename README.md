# Machine_learning_algorithms_from_scratch
Deployment of PCA, LDA, Linear regression, Logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks from scratch

By doing so, we can better understand the underlying mathematical properties of each algorithm and the logic behind each of them. This would help us in undrestanding when each of these algorithms should be used to address a problem.
